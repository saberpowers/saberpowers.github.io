You can call me Scott, or you can call me Powers. I did a PhD in statistics at Stanford University in 2017 and then had a brief career in baseball. I spent five seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where I got a World Series ring as the analytics director in 2020; and I spent one season with the Houston Astros, where I got another World Series ring as an assistant general manager in 2022. By working with two of the most successful teams of the analytics era, I learned how front offices develop strategies to win championships.

Now I am an assistant professor of sport analytics and of statistics at Rice University. These days, I think and write about how competitors should and do respond to rules put in place by leagues. I am interested in how league officials can design incentive structures to make their competitions safer for athletes and more entertaining to fans. Meanwhile, I am developing statistical methodology for modeling kinematic tracking data, with applications in player health and safety.

*Regretfully, I do not have the bandwidth to respond to individual requests from students for video calls or feedback on projects. If you are a potential collaborator with (a) data and (b) research questions, please reach out---I may be able to provide students and brainpower. I am also open to media inquiries.*

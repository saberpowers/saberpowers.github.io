    "text": "Check out the American Soccer Insights Summit!\nI am on parental leave during the 2025 spring semester.\nI am an Assistant Professor of Sport Analytics and of Statistics at Rice University. Much of my work involves what team front offices want to know: (a) how to measure individual contributions to team success in team sports and (b) how to squeeze optimal estimates of player talent from limited data. Building on these results, I research what league offices want to know: how teams and players respond to incentives, from a game theoretic perspective. I want to understand how leagues can design these incentives to promote the health of their sport. My favorite tools for these problems tend to come from statistical machine learning (regularized regression, gradient boosting, etc.) although I am also partial to Bayesian models when appropriate (and when the computational cost is reasonable). My favorite sports are baseball, soccer and volleyball.\nI completed my PhD in statistics at Stanford University in 2017. From there, I worked for the Los Angeles Dodgers in R&D for five years and then spent one season as an Assistant General Manager with the Houston Astros before joining Rice in 2023. Along the way, I’ve kept a thread of consulting, starting with the Oakland Athletics, which led directly to part-time work for AZ Alkmaar, which became part-time work for Zelus Analytics (primarily soccer analytics), which became part-time work for Teamworks (soccer analytics).\nRegretfully, I do not have the bandwidth to respond to individual requests from students for video calls or feedback on projects. If you are a potential collaborator with (a) data and (b) research questions, please reach out—I may be able to provide students and brainpower. I am also open to media inquiries.\n\nIn the news\nLooking for friends among baseball’s most passionate nerds\n2024-09-05 Defector\n​​Scott Powers: Major league analyst acing Rice\n2024-02-13 The Rice Thresher\nWhat volleyball can tell us about what’s missing in MLB analytics\n2023-09-27 The Orange County Register\nAstros fire assistant general manager Scott Powers\n2022-11-11 MLB Trade Rumors\nDodgers executive leaving for Astros front office is traitorous activity\n2022-01-03 Dodgers Way"

    "text": "When I was a hiring manager in analytics for the Dodgers, we would post an entry-level quantitative analyst position and receive nearly a thousand applications. Among those candidates, based on the application alone, roughly half would seem to be qualified for the entry-level position. Without the resources to interview 500 candidates, we had to decide which small subset of candidates would advance to the interview stage (this is its own challenge and a story for another day).\nI relay this experience to you because it conveys some perspective from the other side of the job application process. How will you separate yourself (before the interview stage) from the many other candidates who could be qualified for the position? The best way to make your resume rise to the top of the stack is to work on a research project and present it at a sport analytics conference. If a resume reviewer is already familiar with your work (assuming it’s good work) before seeing your name in the candidate pool, then they are much more likely to offer you an interview. Below, I’ve listed some opportunities to stand out.\nGeneral Sports. New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports (September, Boston) and Cascadia Symposium on Statistics in Sports (September, Vancouver) are sibling conferences, with NESSIS occurring in odd-numbered years and CASSIS occurring in even-numbered years. The academic quality of presentations at these conferences is generally very high. It can be difficult for students to earn presentation slots on stage, but there are also opportunities to give poster presentations. For women and candidates of non-binary gender, Women in Sports Data Symposium (September, Philadelphia) can be an excellent opportunity to present your work on stage in front of industry professionals, including hiring managers. The WISD Symposium features a strong industry presence of any gender in the audience.\nBaseball. Saberseminar (August, Chicago) is a very accessible entry point for students seeking to give their first on-stage presentation at a major conference, featuring 10-minute student presentation slots. Most MLB clubs sponsor and send representatives to Saberseminar. SABR Analytics Conference (March, Phoenix) is a bit more competitive to get a presentation slot, and it is also well-sponsored and well-attended by MLB clubs.\nFootball. It’s not a conference, but the NFL’s Big Data Bowl is the hiring pipeline for football analytics. The contest typically runs from October into January and features thousands(!) of entrants. For this contest, the NFL makes available tracking(!) data and as much as $100,000(!) in prize money. The top contestants are invited to present their work at the NFL Combine (Indianapolis, February) in front of a star-student judge panel that may include a current NFL player(!).\nSoccer. For those of you in Europe (sorry for calling it soccer), Statsbomb Conference (Manchester, October) and Opta Forum (London, March) both allow students (and non-students) to submit research proposals. The top proposals receive proprietary data to complete their projects and invitations to present their work on stage at the events. For those of you in North America, the nascent American Soccer Insights Summit (Houston, January) follows a similar format, with a call for proposals, proprietary data and an opportunity to present on stage."

    "text": "When reporting numeric results, don’t report too many digits.\nFor example, when you use R or Python to calculate the correlation between two vectors, your computer might spit out a result like 0.13083978. The interpretation of this output is that the correlation is 0.13. If you copy and paste the full number 0.13083978 into a report, that does two things:\n\nit injects white noise (083978) into your report, distracting the reader from what’s important; and\nit suggests to the reader that you don’t understand what is the meaning of your result.\n\nWhen presenting your results, your purpose is to convey meaning. As a simple rule of thumb, two or three significant digits would usually be appropriate for this purpose. Four digits would be pushing it, and five or more digits would be over the line.\nWhen plotting two variables that have the same unit of measurement, choose your x- and y-axis limits so that the aspect ratio is close to 1:1.\nThe scale that you choose for your x- and y-axes can have a huge impact on the perception and qualitative interpretation of your results. For example, consider the following two plots which display the exact same data (actual winning percentage on the x-axis and modeled winning percentage on the y-axis, same units for both variables: wins per game).\n \nAt first glance at the first plot, you might jump to the conclusion that modeled winning percentage aligns reasonably with actual winning percentage. But did you notice the scale of the y-axis? The second figure clearly communicates the important takeaway: modeled winning percentage is way more compressed than actual winning percentage. Perhaps this is how things should be, or perhaps this indicates a bug in your model. Either way, the second figure conveys the meaning of your results more effectively.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the list. I will add to it if/when I come across additional common pitfalls that compel me to write them up."

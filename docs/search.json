    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor of Sport Analytics and of Statistics at Rice University. Much of my work involves what team front offices want to know: (a) how to measure individual contributions to team success in team sports and (b) how to squeeze optimal estimates of player talent from limited data. Building on these results, I research what league offices want to know: how teams and players respond to incentives, from a game theoretic perspective. I want to understand how leagues can design these incentives to promote the health of their sport. My favorite tools for these problems tend to come from statistical machine learning (regularized regression, gradient boosting, etc.) although I am also partial to Bayesian models when appropriate (and when the computational cost is reasonable). My favorite sports are baseball, soccer and volleyball.\nI completed my PhD in statistics at Stanford University in 2017. From there, I worked for the Los Angeles Dodgers in R&D for five years and then spent one season as an Assistant General Manager with the Houston Astros before joining Rice in 2023. Along the way, I have held multiple-year consulting engagements with the Oakland Athletics (baseball), AZ Alkmaar (soccer) and Zelus Analytics (baseball and soccer).\n\nIn the news\n2024-09-05 Looking for friends among baseball’s most passionate nerds\nDefector\n2024-02-13 ​​Scott Powers: Major league analyst acing Rice\nThe Rice Thresher\n2023-09-27 What volleyball can tell us about what’s missing in MLB analytics\nThe Orange County Register\n2022-11-11 Astros fire assistant general manager Scott Powers\nMLB Trade Rumors\n2022-01-03 Dodgers executive leaving for Astros front office is traitorous activity\nDodgers Way"

The feedback last semester was largely positive, but some students said they were surprised by the amount of work and how hard the grading was. I grade hard because sport analytics is a very competitive field, and I want to push you to improve yourself. I ask you to adopt a growth mindset this semester and focus on learning over earning a grade. This class involves a lot of math and coding. If you are thinking about dropping the class because you are struggling, I would encourage you to have a conversation with me first in case I can help. 2. By being in this class, you have a unique opportunity that I didn’t have when I was in school. You are surrounded by peers who are passionate about both math and sports. Take advantage of this! I sincerely hope that you will learn from each other more than you learn from me. I have two goals with this class: 1. Give you some tools and the opportunity for hands-on application of ideas; 2. Encourage you to think for yourself. I don’t want to indoctrinate you into a certain way of thinking about sport analytics.

To do this, we’ll need to split our data into two halves. Because we’ll be peforming the same computations on each half of data, it will help to create a function that we can call multiple times (instead of duplicating code).\nEXERCISE #0\nCreate a function that takes in a dataframe of scores (like the one we read from a CSV at the top of this notebook) and returns a dataframe with each team’s wins, losses, points scored and points allowed in each season.\n\ncalculate_record &lt;- function(data) {                                                              #\n\n  # Calculate each team's home record                                                             #\n  record_home &lt;- data |&gt;                                                                          #\n    dplyr::group_by(season, team = home_team) |&gt;                                                  #\n    dplyr::summarize(                                                                             #\n      wins = sum(home_score &gt; away_score),                                                        #\n      losses = sum(home_score &lt; away_score),                                                      #\n      ties = sum(home_score == away_score),                                                       #\n      points_scored = sum(home_score),                                                            #\n      points_allowed = sum(away_score)                                                            #\n    )                                                                                             #\n\n  # Calculate each team's away record                                                             #\n  record_away &lt;- data |&gt;                                                                          #\n    dplyr::group_by(season, team = away_team) |&gt;                                                  #\n    dplyr::summarize(                                                                             #\n      wins = sum(away_score &gt; home_score),                                                        #\n      losses = sum(away_score &lt; home_score),                                                      #\n      ties = sum(away_score == home_score),                                                       #\n      points_scored = sum(away_score),                                                            #\n      points_allowed = sum(home_score)                                                            #\n    )                                                                                             #\n\n  # Calculate each team's record (combining their wins and their losses)                          #\n  record &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(record_home, record_away) |&gt;                                         #\n    dplyr::group_by(season, team) |&gt;                                                              #\n    dplyr::summarize(                                                                             #\n      wins = sum(wins),                                                                           #\n      losses = sum(losses),                                                                       #\n      ties = sum(ties),                                                                           #\n      points_scored = sum(points_scored),                                                         #\n      points_allowed = sum(points_allowed)                                                        #\n    )                                                                                             #\n\n  return(record)                                                                                  #\n}                                                                                                 #\n\nEXERCISE #1\nCalculate actual winning percentage and Pythagorean winning percentage for each team in the first half of each season (games up to and including Week 9) and the second half of each season (games Week 10 and beyond).\n\nwin_pct_1 &lt;- data |&gt;                                                                              #\n  dplyr::filter(week &lt;= 9) |&gt;                                                                     #\n  calculate_record() |&gt;                                                                           #\n  calculate_win_pct(alpha = alpha_min)                                                            #\n\nwin_pct_2 &lt;- data |&gt;                                                                              #\n  dplyr::filter(week &gt;= 10) |&gt;                                                                    #\n  calculate_record() |&gt;                                                                           #\n  calculate_win_pct(alpha = alpha_min)                                                            #\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'season'.

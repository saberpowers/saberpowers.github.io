    "text": "I am an Assistant Professor of Sport Analytics and of Statistics at Rice University. My expertise is in the measurement of individual contributions to team success, as well as the projection of player performance. I have a budding interest in modeling kinematic tracking data and overhead athlete injuries. My favorite tools for these problems tend to come from statistical machine learning (regularized regression, gradient boosting, etc.) although I am also partial to Bayesian models when appropriate (and when the computational cost is reasonable). My favorite sports are baseball, soccer and volleyball.\nI completed my PhD in statistics at Stanford University in 2017. From there, I worked for the Los Angeles Dodgers in R&D for five years and then spent one season as an Assistant General Manager with the Houston Astros before joining Rice in 2023. Along the way, I have held multiple-year consulting engagements with the Oakland Athletics (baseball), AZ Alkmaar (soccer) and Zelus Analytics (baseball and soccer)."

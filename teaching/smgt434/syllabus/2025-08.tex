\textbf{\textsc{Course Overview}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  This is a project-based course built around the NFL Big Data Bowl. The Big Data Bowl is an annual competition hosted by the National Football League in which they release player tracking data and a high-level theme to inspire research projects. This is a valuable opportunity to develop your technical skills using cutting-edge data and potentially to make yourself stand out to hiring managers in football analytics and across all of sport analytics.\\
  ~\\
  The core of what I expect you to do for this course is to complete an actual submission to the Big Data Bowl. Because we expect the NFL to release the data and theme around the midterm recess, we will use the first half of the course to review past Big Data Bowls and to practice skills for working with tracking data so you are prepared to hit the ground running. The second half of the course will be all about completing your project.\\
  ~\\
  You are expected to attend all class periods. If you will miss a class, please notify me via email at least one hour before class starts.
\end{adjustwidth}

\textbf{\textsc{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Apply statistical models to raw player tracking data.
    \item Propose unique research questions useful to NFL teams.
    \item Identify appropriate statistical models for research questions.
    \item Compose easy-to-follow reports with clearly defined motivation.
    \item Develop data visualizations that are accessible, accurate and innovative.
    \item Explain how neural networks work and why they are useful in football analytics.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{\textsc{How Your Grade Is Determined}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
	Your grade is based on your percentage earned of available points.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rclcrclcrcl}
                      &               &     & & $[93\%,\,\infty)$ & $\rightarrow$ & A & & $[90\%, 93\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& A--\\
      $[87\%, 90\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& B+  & & $[83\%, 87\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & B & & $[80\%, 83\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& B--\\
      $[77\%, 80\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& C+  & & $[73\%, 77\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & C & & $[70\%, 73\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& C--\\
      $[67\%, 70\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& D+  & & $[63\%, 67\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & D & & $[60\%, 63\%)$ & $\rightarrow$  & D--\\
                      &               &     & & $[ 0\%, 60\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & F\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  ~\\
  There are five assignments, each worth 20\% of the course grade. We will randomly assign groups for each of the first three assignments, which will be graded for completion. You get to pick your squad (the maximum team size is 4) for the final two assignments, which will be graded for quality.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Past Finalist Review
    \item Play Animation
    \item Past Finalist Reproduction
    \item Progress Report
    \item Big Data Bowl Submission
  \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Late Work.} You may submit late work subject to a $10\%$ score deduction for each late day.

  \textbf{Absence Policy.} If you notify me of your absence before the beginning of class, you will receive an opportunity to make up your absence.

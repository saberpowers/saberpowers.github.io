\textbf{\textsc{Expectations}} \hspace{1cm} {\it Credit: Tom Stallings}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}

  Do not assume you can take off work if you have a friend in town, a class project you are behind on or your birthday, etc. These are not acceptable reasons to take the day off in an internship. In addition, internship site obligations may supersede university declarations. For example, Rice administration may announce school holidays when classes are off, but unless requested in advance, internship obligations would be expected to be maintained.

  Please arrange in advance any days that you will be off. Family reunions, weddings, varsity athletic obligations, club sports obligations or other Rice-sponsored organization activities (e.g. Rice Speech and Debate Club competitions, theater or music performances, conferences) are examples of acceptable reasons to request time off. In a business setting, you will have other obligations that may take you away from the workplace. The key is to let your supervisor know as far in advance as possible. You and your supervisor must agree in advance to these requested days off, and it is recommended that you submit these dates in writing to your site supervisor with a copy sent to your instructor. If you have any doubt, reach out to your instructor in advance of making the request with your employer.

  Dress appropriately! Part of showing respect for your internship is showing respect for the dress code in your office. Many offices frown upon jeans, sandals, t-shirts, revealing clothing and other attire common in the college setting. If you are not sure what appropriate office attire is for your internship, take a look around at your colleagues or consult directly with your site supervisor or your company's HR department.

  To really make an impact, an intern should seek to identify an organizational need, research ways to address that need, propose solutions to solve the challenges, review the proposal with your site supervisor and implement the recommendations successfully. Your goal is to make a substantive impact, which will increase your chances of securing a strong recommendation for future opportunities or receiving a full-time job offer.

  \textbf{Final Performance Evaluation.} ($75$pts) It is your responsibility to remind your internship supervisor to complete your final performance evaluation at the end of the semester.

\textbf{\textsc{Title IX Responsible Employee Notification}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  At Rice University, unlawful discrimination in any form, including sexual misconduct, is prohibited under Rice Policy on Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Policy 830) and the Student Code of Conduct.

  Please be aware that all employees of Rice University are ``mandatory reporters'', which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.

  Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

  To report sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@rice.edu. To explore supportive measures and other resources that are available to you, please visit the Office if Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support at safe.rice.edu.

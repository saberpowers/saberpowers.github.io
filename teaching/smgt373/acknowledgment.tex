    \Large SMGT 373/374: Sport Analytics Internship \\ Supervisor Acknowledgment Form
  \end{center}
  ~

  I acknowledge that
  \underline{\hspace{8cm}} {\it \small (student name)}\\
  will intern with
  \underline{\hspace{11cm}} {\it \small (organization name)}\\
  as
  \underline{\hspace{13cm}} {\it \small (job title)}\\
  starting
  \underline{\hspace{5cm}} {\it \small (start date)}
  and ending
  \underline{\hspace{5cm}} {\it \small (end date)}.\\

  Further, I acknowledge that the student will complete the internship for academic credit, which comes with the following requirements:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The student will work a minimum of 150 hours during the semester of the internship. This must be a sport analytics internship, and the student needs a job description which includes a list of job responsibilities with percentage weights that sum to 100\%.
    \item As the intership supervisor, I will complete a midterm performance evaluation for the student halfway through the semester and a final performance evaluation for the student at the end of the semester. The student will be responsible for providing performance evaluation forms and reminding me about performance evaluation deadlines.
  \end{enumerate}

<h3 id="homework"><a href="homework.html">Homework</a> (40%)</h3>
<p>Four homework assignments will be due on April 24, May 1, May 8 and May 15
  (all Wednesdays, subject to change). Each assignment will be announced at least
   one week in advance. Each homework submission should be typeset on a computer,
   and then submitted on Gradescope:  think of it as a report you would have to
   write for the front-office of a professional sport team!  It also should be
   confined to one page, front and  back. To clarify, this means that two
   pages is the  maximum length  allowed  for  ahomework submission.
     Students may work in pairs on homework assignments. </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="project"><a href="project.html">Project</a> (40%)</h3>
<p>The final project is a research paper on the subject of your choosing.
  Ideally, your project should include the following steps: pose a research
  question with respect to sports performance or analysis, gather some
  relevant data, and analyze it using the different methods and techniques
  seen in class, or even some statistical tools out of scope. In the end,
  your project should try to give a concrete answer to the problem
 at stake. The maximum length for the research paper is eight pages
  (i.e. four front and back), and the deadline is Wednesday, May 29.
 You will be expected to give a 20-minute presentation on your
  work in the final weeks of the course. Students are encouraged to work
   in pairs on the final project. </p>

  <p> We strongly encourage you to check on the previous years' projects,
    as they can make a good start for a project on your own and provide you with
    a lot of potential projects ideas.
    Another project topic which would be totally fine would consist in trying to
    participate to a data science project in sports, such as this
    <a href="https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/xpsg"> one</a>, organized by
    PSG.

<h3 id="participation">Participation (20%)</h3>
<p>Class participation has three components:
<p><em>10% Class attendance</em>. We want you to attend every guest speaker's
  lecture, as well as the R sessions, as they should be really helpful for your
  final project. This will make for half your participation grade. Submitting
  the Surveys that we will hand over and engaging Maxime, Damian and Marius
  during their office hours will also get you additional participation points.
<p><em>5% Piazza participation</em>. For the remainder of the term we will use
<a href="https://piazza.com/stanford/spring2019/stats50/home"
target="_blank">Piazza</a> for class discussion. You get a point each time you
(1) ask a question about lecture material; (2) answer a question about lecture
material; or (3) answer a question about homework. You can accrue a maximum of
five points, which make up this portion of your participation grade.
<p><em>5% R</em>. To earn this participation credit, you must either: (1)
complete a challenge at the end of one of the R tutorial scripts and post your
code and results on
<a href="https://piazza.com/stanford/spring2019/stats50/home"
target="_blank">Piazza</a>; or (2) complete one of the three interactive R
tutorials in the <a href="r.html#resources">resources</a> section of the R tab
and post a screenshot
demonstrating your completion of it, along with a one-sentence review of the
tutorial (thumbs up or thumbs down, and why); or (3) find another resource for
learning R online and post two paragraphs on
<a href="https://piazza.com/stanford/spring2019/stats50/home"
target="_blank">Piazza</a> explaining what it is and
why you think it is a good resource for learning R.

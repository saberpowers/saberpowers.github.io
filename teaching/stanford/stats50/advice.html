<h3>Advice from past Stats 50 students</h3>
<hr>

<p class="lead">Most importantly

<p>"Come into the class with a sense of what you want to learn from it and
focus on because this will help you really apply what you learn in class to
your own interests during the homework."
<hr>

<p class="lead">On when to start your final project

<p>"Start your project early!"

<p>"I would advise future Stats 50 students to go to every class and
<u>definitely</u> to start the final project early. I wish we had started
earlier because we would have been able to do a much better job and a much more
interesting analysis."

<p>"Start your project early and challenge yourself. This class is what you
make of it. I think everyone loves sports but might be timid in getting
seriously involved. I challenged myself and learned a lot and am super thankful
that I did."

<p>"Don't save the project for the last minute; come up with an idea early so
you can think about it as the course goes on."
<hr>

<p class="lead">On learning R

<p>"Take the time to learn R at [the] beginning of the class... [It] will save
you time in [the] long run."

<p>"Invest some effort early in the quarter to learn R. Don't treat it as a ...
low-effort class just because it's about a topic that isn't traditionally
academic."

<p>"Learn R well!"

<p>"Make sure to go through the R day scripts in full and that you understand
what is going on, so that when it comes time for the homework you are ready."

<p>"Make time to finish R work after class each week -- much more rewarding
that way! ... Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if the rest of the class
knows the answer!"

<p>"Don't just copy Scott's code with tiny changes for HW. First try to
implement it yourself without referencing it, then if you're stuck you can
look."

<p>"Spend time throughout the quarter learning R on your own, not just through
the assignments."

<p>"I would say it is important to do the R tutorials before starding to make
sure you are up to speed. Also office hours are helpful for making sure models
in R run correctly. Also pick a project you are interested in -- it makes it
more fun!"
<hr>

<p class="lead">Miscellaneous

<p>"Pick homework topics you really care about (forces you to learn it well)."

<p>"Find a sport/topic you love, and keep pursuing it more in-depth throughout
the quarter."

<p>"Make sure if you aren't following a sport, to pick one to be able to better
understand the material. Students should choose a sport at the beginning of the
quarter and stick with it throughout."

<p>"Challenge yourself with the HW assignments to get the most out of the
class. Know the basics of R so you can hit the ground running in tutorials."

<p>"Have some basic experience with statistics and preferably some coding
experience beforehand."

<p>"Feel free beyond the course to look for data and data analysis tools to do
even more extensive analysis"

<p>"Spend more time getting comfortable with the models."

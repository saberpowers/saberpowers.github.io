<h3>Homework Policy</h3>
<p>Each homework submission may be a maximum of one page, front and back. To clarify,
   this means that two pages is the maximum length allowed for a homework submission.
  It should be typeset on a computer. You will have
to upload your submission on Gradescope. You can enroll for the course with the
following entry code: <strong> MDKDZG</strong>.

<h3 id="1">Homework 1</h3>
<p class="lead">Due Wednesday, April 17</p>
<p><a href="files/hw1rubric.pdf" target="_blank">Grading Rubric</a>
<p>Past exemplary work:
<ul>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM1_1.pdf" target="_blank">Basketball (2016)</a>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM1_2.pdf" target="_blank">Soccer (2016)</a>
</ul>
<p>For the team sport of your choosing, invent a method for evaluating
individual performance in terms of how it leads to team success.
Imagine that you have been hired as a
statistical analyst and the general manager has tasked you with creating
ratings for individual players. How can the
team determine which players to acquire?

<p>Your assignment is to write a report describing in detail how to compute
your proposed player ratings. Your method should lead to a statistic which
estimates the value added by each player to whom it applies, in terms of team
winning or scoring, relative to a league-average player.
Note that your task is not to actually
compute this statistic but rather to describe how to do so in enough detail
that another statistical analyst could read your proposal and implement it
herself. You may choose to focus on just one aspect of the
sport. For example, the only aspect of baseball that wOBA evaluates is batting.
Your report should address the following questions:
<ul>
    <li>What data are needed to compute these player evaluations? Are these
        data available publicly? Privately? If these data do not currently
        exist, what labor or technology would be required to gather the data?
    <li>What are the limitations of the proposed method? In what ways might it
        fail to accurately isolate individual performance from team
        performance? What aspects of performance does it miss?
    <li>What is the most similar statistic in the public domain for evaluating
        individual performance? How is the proposed statistic different from
        what is publicly available?
</ul>
<p>If you are struggling to find inspiration, here is an idea that you may use
as the basis of your report:
<p><em>Invent a method for rating NFL quarterbacks
  in terms of point scoring. For each quarterback, this rating should estimate
how many fewer (or more) points his team would score per game if he were
replaced by a league-average quarterback.</em>

<p> Feel free to choose a sport that you feel passionate about, and to provide us
with specific instances in which your method would be effective and/or deficient.
We want to learn things from you!

<h3 id="2">Homework 2</h3>
<p class="lead">Due Friday, April 26
<p><a href="files/hw2rubric.pdf" target="_blank">Grading Rubric</a>
<p>Past exemplary work:
<ul>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM2_1.pdf" target="_blank">Basketball (2016)</a>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM2_2.pdf" target="_blank">Golf (2016)</a>
</ul>

<p>Pick a statistic (e.g. pass completion percentage in soccer) and find a
dataset which reports this statistic for a set of athletes. Perform regression
to the mean to estimate the true talent level in this statistic for all of the
athletes in the dataset. A necessary component of this assignment is estimating
the population standard deviation in underlying true talent for this statistic,
in the set of athletes you have chosen to consider. If the statistic you have
chosen is not a binomial percentage, then you will also have to estimate the
sampling variance of the statistic. It can be interesting (but not mandatory) to
also try and apply on the same statistic the Empirical Bayes method studied in
class, where you first estimate the distribution of your statistic across all players,
and then find individual estimates for each of them. In particular, you can compare how
this Bayes estimator compares with the James-Stein estimator (regression to the mean).
<p>Report your estimate of population standard deviation in underlying true
talent for the statistic, and present a plot of estimated true talent versus
observed statistic, with each athlete being one datapoint. In that plot,
include the diagonal line <em>y = x</em> for reference. Pick one athlete and
give that athlete's statistic and estimated true talent. Explain the
interpretation of your estimated true talent for that athlete. In summary, your
report should include:
<ul>
    <li>An explanation of the statistic and dataset you chose (and where you
        found it)
    <li>An estimate of the population standard deviation in underlying true
        talent for this statistic
    <li>A plot of estimated true talent versus observed statistic
    <li>The interpretation of the results for one athlete of your choice
    <li>Your code in a separate document (see below)
</ul>
<p>As with all homework reports, imagine that your audience is a front office
executive and write prose that smoothly addresses all of the components of the
prompt.
<p><strong>When you submit your homework, include the code as an appendix to
your main write-up.</strong>. We expect your code to fit on one page, front
and back. If it does not, this suggests that you're making this harder on
yourself than it needs to be. Consult the course staff for help.
<p>If you are struggling for inspiration, you may use the dataset below as the
basis of your report. For all players in the 2015-16 English Premier League, it
includes total number of attempted passes and total number of successful
passes. Estimate the true talent successful pass percentage for all players in
the dataset. You are of course free to choose any statistic reflecting any
 personal interest or preference, or even one which could later lead to a more
 through analysis in a potential final project.

<h3 id="3">Homework 3</h3>
<p class="lead">Due Wednesday, May 8</p>

<p><a href="files/hw3rubric.pdf" target="_blank">Grading Rubric</a>
<p>Past exemplary work:
<ul>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM3_1.pdf" target="_blank">Basketball (2016)</a>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM3_2.pdf" target="_blank">Baseball (2016)</a>
</ul>

<p>Find a dataset of game scores for the league or competition of your choice.
Hold out the last (chronologically) 20% of the data as a test set. On the first
80% of the data, fit (1) the regularized <em>normal</em> Bradley-Terry model
and (2) the regularized <em>binomial</em> Bradley-Terry model to rank the teams
or players in the league or competition. Use each model to predict the winners
of the matchups in the last 20% of the data, which you had previously held out.
Present a figure which visualizes some aspect of your results, and include your
code as an appendix to your homework submission.
<p>The meat of this assignment is your presentation and interpretation of your
results. Include several paragraphs (roughly half to three-quarters of a page)
discussing your results. Questions that you could address in this discussion
include: <em>Which teams or players did each model identify as the best (and
worst)? Does that agree with the popular consensus of who the best and worst
teams are? What data are missing from these models that could lead to better
rankings or matchup predictions? How does your model compare with how
accurately Las Vegas sportsbooks are able to pick winners in this league or
competition?</em> Think up your own questions, too.
<p>At minimum, your report should include:
<ul>
    <li>Results (rankings) from fitting the Bradley-Terry models to the
        first 80% of the data
    <li>Results of using each model to predict winners in the last 20%
        of the data (Which model did better?)
    <li>A figure of your choice visualizing some aspect of your results
    <li>A (several-paragraph) discussion of your results (as a whole) on this
        dataset (see above)
    <li>Your code as an appendix
</ul>
<p>As always, prepare your report for a front office executive (or coach) in the
league you are analyzing. Imagine that your audience is interested in
understanding who are the best teams in the league, with more sophisticated
analysis than counting wins and losses. The task here is not just to find "the
answer" but to communicate all of your findings effectively.

<p>If your code does not fit on one page,
front and back, seek help. If you are struggling for inspiration, use the
college basketball data from <a href="r.html#2">R Tutorial 2</a>.

<h3 id="4">Homework 4</h3>
<p class="lead">Due Wednesday, May 15</p>

<p><a href="files/hw4rubric.pdf" target="_blank">Grading Rubric</a>
<p>Past exemplary work:
<ul>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM4_1.pdf" target="_blank">Basketball (2016)</a>
    <li><a href="files/example_HM4_2.pdf" target="_blank">Football (2016)</a>
</ul>
<p>Find a dataset of event results (as opposed to game results
for the previous assignment) for the sport of your choosing. The data should
include the identity of at least one player for each event. Examples of
datasets you could use are:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Soccer</strong>: Shots<br>
        Offensive adversary: the shooter<br>
        Defensive adversary: the goalie<br>
        Other variables: the location of the shot, e.g.<br>
        Outcome variable: indicator of whether goal is scored
    <li><strong>Football</strong>: Running plays<br>
        Offensive adversary: the running back<br>
        Defensive adversary: the defensive team<br>
        Other variables: the distance to go for first down, e.g.<br>
        Outcome variable: number of yards gained by rusher
    <li><strong>Basketball</strong>: Missed shots<br>
        Offensive adversaries: the offensive players on the floor<br>
        Defensive adversaries: the defensive players on the floor<br>
        Other variables: indicator of whether shot was a three-pointer, e.g.<br>
        Outcome variable: indicator of whether defense got the rebound
    <li><strong>Baseball</strong>: At bats<br>
        Offensive adversary: the batter<br>
        Defensive adversary: the pitcher<br>
        Other variables: the stadium, e.g.<br>
        Outcome to model: wOBA value of the at bat result
    <li><strong>Golf</strong>: Holes<br>
        Offensive adversary: the golfer<br>
        Defensive adversary: the hole<br>
        Outcome variable: number of strokes
</ul>
<p>For your chosen dataset, describe the offensive and defensive adversaries,
what other variables you have chosen to include in the model, and what outcome
variable you are modelling. Use the data to fit a Rasch model. Report
the top five and bottom five offensive and defensive adversaries from your
model fit. Comment on the estimated regression coefficients for the "other"
variables. Do the values match your intuition for what they should be? What
other variables have you not included in the model that might be worth
including? Include some vizualization of your results. Try to address all of
the points in this paragraph through a smooth discussion of your results.
<p>The objective here is not to just "answer all of the questions" but rather
to present the results you obtain from fitting the Rasch model in smooth prose.
Imagine that a front office executive has asked you to evaluate the offensive
and defensive adversaries in your model and that he is going to use your report
to make decisions about what players to acquire.
<p>Include your code as an appendix to your submission.  If your code does not
fit on one page, front and back, seek help. If you are struggling for
inspiration, use the MLB play-by-play data from
<a href="r.html#3">R Tutorial 3</a>. You could, for example, model
the probability that a plate appearance results in a strikeout. Alternatively,
you could model the probability that a plate appearance results in a home run.
A more comprehensive task would be to model the wOBA weight of the plate
appearance outcome. The choice is yours!

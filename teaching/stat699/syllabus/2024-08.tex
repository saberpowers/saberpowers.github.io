\textbf{\textsc{Course Overview}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  This course is intended for students interested in research on sports applications of quantitative methods (statistics, computer science, data science, etc.). In an informal seminar style, we will discuss a selection of the latest academic journal articles in sport analytics, as guided by student interest. Each week, one student will choose a paper and prepare a 20-minute oral presentation for the rest of the class, leaving space for discussion.\\
  ~\\
  A goal of this course is to foster research collaborations and opportunities for students. We hope to spin off research projects from ideas discussed in class. In addition to reading papers, we will set aside time to brainstorm and share ideas. Presenters may substitute their own research instead of summarizing a paper.\\
  ~\\
  {\bf The only enrollment offered is one credit hour per semester (repeatable for credit).}

  At Rice University, unlawful discrimination in any form, including sexual misconduct, is prohibited under Rice Policy on Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Policy 830) and the Student Code of Conduct.

  Please be aware that all employees of Rice University are ``mandatory reporters'', which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.

  Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

  To report sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@rice.edu. To explore supportive measures and other resources that are available to you, please visit the Office if Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support at safe.rice.edu.

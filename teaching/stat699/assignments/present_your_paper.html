<p>Your assignment is to carefully read an academic journal article which features mathematical modeling (statistics, computer science, applied math, operations research, etc.) applied to data from sports. Create a slide deck, and give a 20-minute presentation to the rest of the class summarizing the paper. Assume your audience has not read the paper.</p>
<p>There are only two structural requirements for your presentation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Please preface your presentation by reporting to the class how much of the paper you understood, on a scale from 0% to 100%. It's okay to be honest if it's a low percentage---you will NOT be graded on this number.</li>
    <li>I want the first slide of your presentation to be an image created by generative AI, illustrating the core concept of the paper. The purpose of this image is functional---we will use it throughout the semester to refer back and jog memories of your paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>When submitting this assignment, please upload your AI-generated image in .jpg format. There is no need to upload your slides.</p>

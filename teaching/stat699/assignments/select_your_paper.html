<p>A list of Candidate Papers is available on the Canvas home page, but you are not required to select from this list. I encourage you to search Google Scholar for sports and modeling techniques that interest you. During this search, keep an eye out for papers in the following journals:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The most preferred journals are statistics-discipline journals such as <em>Journal of the American Statistical Association</em>, <em>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C</em>, <em>Annals of Applied Statistics</em> or <em>The American Statistician</em>.</li>
    <li>The next-most preferred journal is the <em>Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports</em>.</li>
    <li>Another journal you could consider is the <em>Journal of Sports Analytics</em>.</li>
    <li>There are no hard rules regarding the journal from which you select your paper. Some papers that do not appear in the above journals are better than some papers that do appear in the above journals.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you think you have found your paper, please skim through it to make sure you are not biting off more than you can chew. The deadline to submit your selection is 8 days before your presentation.</p>

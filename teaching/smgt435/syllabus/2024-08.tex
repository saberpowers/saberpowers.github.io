\textbf{\textsc{Topics}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  The general flow is that we will alternate between (a) discussing math/models using a whiteboard and (b) implementing these concepts in code. The course is divided into $4$ units, each approximately $4$ weeks:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unit $1$: Measuring Batting Performance\\
    Pythagorean Formula, Base-Out Run Expectancy, Linear Weights, Batted Ball Outcome Model
    \item Unit $2$: Measuring Pitching Performance\\
    BABIP/FIP/DIPS, Count Value, Catcher Framing, Pitch Outcome Model, Stuff
    \item Unit $3$: Valuing Player Performance\\
    Baserunning Evaluation, Fielding Evaluation, Replacement Level, Positional Adjustment, WAR
    \item Unit $4$: Practicum\\
    Guest Speakers, Student Projects
  \end{itemize}
\end{adjustwidth}

\textbf{\textsc{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Separate signal from noise in baseball performance data.
    \item Design and calculate your own WAR metric using R and publicly available MLB data.
    \item Describe applications of analytics for supporting in-game strategy and player development.
    \item Identify an interesting research problem in baseball, solve it with data, and present your solution.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{\textsc{How Your Grade Is Determined}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
	Sport analytics is a demanding and highly competitive field. This class aims to provide the tough but honest feedback that you will need to succeed in it. Note that the points below sum approximately (but not exactly) to $100$. Your grade is based on your percentage earned of available points.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rclcrclcrcl}
                      &               &     & & $[93\%,\,\infty)$ & $\rightarrow$ & A & & $[90\%, 93\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& A--\\
      $[87\%, 90\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& B+  & & $[83\%, 87\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & B & & $[80\%, 83\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& B--\\
      $[77\%, 80\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& C+  & & $[73\%, 77\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & C & & $[70\%, 73\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& C--\\
      $[67\%, 70\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& D+  & & $[63\%, 67\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & D & & $[60\%, 63\%)$ & $\rightarrow$  & D--\\
                      &               &     & & $[ 0\%, 60\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & F\\

  \end{center}

	\textbf{Assignments.} ($40$pts) There are $4$ individual assignments, each worth $10$pts. You are encouraged to help each other, but your submission must reflect work you have done yourself. Assignments will be graded anonymously, so please remove any personally identifying information from your submission. The expected completion time for each assignment is $10$ hours.

  \textbf{Project.} ($40$pts) This is a project-based course, and the project you build in stages over the course of the semester will determine a large chunk of your grade. You are encouraged to work with a partner on the project (no more than $2$ students per team), but you may work individually if you wish.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Project \#$0$ ($0$pts): Registration                   \hfill expected hours: $1$
    \item Project \#$1$ ($5$pts): Proposal                       \hfill expected hours: $5$
    \item Project \#$2$ ($10$pts): Abstract                      \hfill expected hours: $10$
    \item Project \#$3$ ($5$pts): Presentation                   \hfill expected hours: $5$
    \item Project \#$4$ ($20$pts): Paper                         \hfill expected hours: $20$
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Quarter Quizzes.} ($10$pts) There are $4$ quarter quizzes (one at the end of each unit), each worth $2.5$pts. Each quiz is cumulative, meaning that it covers material from previous units as well as the most recent unit.

  \textbf{Attendance.} ($0.5$pts per class) Showing up is a requirement for most jobs in sport analytics. In this class, you are expected to show up and engage in discussions, which are part of the learning experience. We will keep attendance and collect feedback using exit tickets at the end of almost every class although there will be a few days we skip this (these days will not be counted toward your attendance grade).

  \textbf{Late Work.} You may submit late work subject to a $10\%$ score deduction for each late day.

  \textbf{Absence Policy.} If you notify me of your absence before the beginning of class, you will receive an opportunity to make up your absence.

\textbf{\textsc{Disability Resource Center}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  If you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: $1$) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room $111$ / \href{mailto:adarice@rice.edu}{adarice@rice.edu} / x$5841$) to determine the accommodations you need; and $2$) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.

\textbf{\textsc{Mental Health Policy}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
	The wellbeing and mental health of students is important; if you are having trouble completing your coursework, please reach out to the Wellbeing and Counseling Center. Rice University provides cost-free mental health services through the Wellbeing and Counseling Center to help you manage personal challenges that threaten your personal or academic well-being. If you believe you are experiencing unusual amounts of stress, sadness, or anxiety, the Student Wellbeing Office or the Rice Counseling Center may be able to assist you.

\textbf{\textsc{Title IX Responsible Employee Notification}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  At Rice University, unlawful discrimination in any form, including sexual misconduct, is prohibited under Rice Policy on Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Policy 830) and the Student Code of Conduct.

  Please be aware that all employees of Rice University are ``mandatory reporters'', which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.

  Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

  To report sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@rice.edu. To explore supportive measures and other resources that are available to you, please visit the Office if Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support at safe.rice.edu.

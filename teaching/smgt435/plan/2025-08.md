- 5 minutes discuss at tables
- 9 minutes large group discussion
1. Why is the Pythagorean formula important?
2. What are some reasons a team might truly be better than their Pythagorean record suggets?
3. If a team plays 10 games, what do you think will be more predictive of their future record: Pythag W\% or actual W\%? If the team plays 10 million games? At how many games do you switch from preferring Pythag W\% to actual W\%?

7:25-7:40 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record
- Don't derive the correlation result; just present it

7:40-7:55 Pythagorean formula discussion, part 2
- Ample time for questions about regression to the mean model

- test out Colab's AI feature

- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

Reflections
- I didn't provide a convincing argument that you should prefer Pythag over actual W% in a 10-game sample
- 2.5 hour class is tough, but students gave it a good effort on engagement
- Students were most engaged when we pulled up the actual baseball standings on FanGraphs
  - Good to make the concepts more concreate with real-life data

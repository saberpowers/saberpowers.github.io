## 2025-08-25

7:00-7:05 Introductions (favorite baseball team, career aspirations)
- Discuss Dodgers/Padres series
- Discuss Padres/Mariners series (upcoming)

7:05-7:05 Randomly assign students to tables
- Create a question scoreboard

7:05-7:10 Syllabus review
- MLB club interview assessment
- MLB club project partnership

7:10-7:25 Pythagorean formula discussion, part 1
- 1 minute think
- 5 minutes discuss at tables
- 9 minutes large group discussion
1. Why is the Pythagorean formula important?
2. What are some reasons a team might truly be better than their Pythagorean record suggets?
3. If a team plays 10 games, what do you think will be more predictive of their future record: Pythag W\% or actual W\%? If the team plays 10 million games? At how many games do you switch from preferring Pythag W\% to actual W\%?

7:25-7:40 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record
- Don't derive the correlation result; just present it

7:40-7:55 Pythagorean formula discussion, part 2
- Ample time for questions about regression to the mean model
- What MLB teams have most underperformed or overperformed their Pythagorean records this season? What are the implications of this observation?

7:55-8:00 Start Colab notebook
- test out Colab's AI feature

- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

Reflections
- I didn't provide a convincing argument that you should prefer Pythag over actual W% in a 10-game sample
- 2.5 hour class is tough, but students gave it a good effort on engagement
- Students were most engaged when we pulled up the actual baseball standings on FanGraphs
  - Good to make the concepts more concreate with real-life data

Notable comments from last class:

7:00-7:05 Discuss Blue Jays/Yankees series, Tigers/Yankees series

7:05 divide students into tables

7:05-7:15 Discuss confusions from last class
- What exactly is bootstrapping?
- Can I prove that Pythag is preferred in a 10-game sample?
- Start by writing down the model again
  - Explain the connection between this and linear regression
  - Explain the concept of a "multilevel" model
- Conceptualizing noise and signal variance

7:15-7:30 Discussion 1
1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of RE24 and LW relative to each other?
2. If you were creating a WAR metric, which would you use as the basis for batter evaluation?
3. What reasons might the residual RE24 - LW reflect true talent rather than luck?

7:30-7:40 Table Exercises 1
1. According to the FanGraphs Major League Leaders page for batting, who has the highest RE24 in the current season? Who has the highest LW?
2. According to the FanGraphs projected standings for the current season, which team has the best BaseRuns record? What is the difference between BaseRuns record and PythagenPat record?

7:40-7:50 Open to questions about RE24/LW and about the model for regression to the mean
- Write the model and the formula for regression to the mean on the board

7:50-8:00 Table Exercises 2
1. Suppose that the "true talent" of the residual RE24 -- LW for MLB batters is normally distributed with mean zero and *standard deviation* 0.02. Suppose further that the noise variance of observed performance is $0.2/n$, where $n$ is the number of plate appearances observed. If a batter accumulates 30 LW and 60 RE24 over 1,000 plate appearances, what is the posterior mean of their "true talent" residual per plate appearance (RE24 -- LW)/$n$?

- When we say "luck" does it just refer to all noise? Like do luck and clutch mean the same thing in terms of noise, or is there a reason why we assume luck over clutch? Also, why do we not assume clutch is actually skill?

- I think the Monday evening time made me lose focus at certain points, I think I just got caught up in all the terminologies and formulas of the modeling, and am still a bit confused about the interaction between the noise and signal variances and how they impact each other.¬†
- I feel like I keep confusing signal and noise variance and don't really know how to derive it. I was confused for part 2.

- How do we get the weights on Zj and 0?

- Maybe we went over this in class and I missed it, but I would love to see a mathematical proof of why LW is better than RE24. Intuitively it makes sense but it would be cool if it could be proved - if even possible.

7:00 Remind students about internships!

7:00-7:20 Write the model on the board and discuss exit ticket questions

7:20-7:35 Discussion 1
- Find the Baseball Savant player batting leaderboard. Who is leading the league in xwOBA? Who has the biggest gap between their wOBA and their xwOBA?
- What is the relationship between xwOBA (from Baseball Savant) and xLW3 (from the lecture notes)?
- Why might a batter's true-talent LW on batted balls be higher than their true-talent xLW3?

7:35-7:50 Question Game (review batted ball outcome model lecture notes)

7:50-8:05 Discussion 2
- Suppose that the true talent of the residual LW -- xLW3 for MLB batters is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 0.02. Suppose further that the noise variance of observed performance is 0.2 / n, where n is the number of plate appearances observed. If a batter accumulates 20 xLW3 and 60 LW over 500 plate appearances, what is the posterior mean of their "true talent" residual per plate appearance (LW -- xLW3) / n?
- Which do you think is the best metric to evaluate batters: xLW3, xLW2 or xLW1?

Reflections
- Today seemed particularly difficult to get the students engaged with questions, not sure why

Reasons why students were quiet:
- I mostly don't know what to ask yet. I want to hear you cover some material first to see what makes sense to me or confuses me further and then ask.
- Personally, I tend to be quiet because I don't even know what to ask, but I don't know if the same applies to the rest of the class
- also for discussion I feel like I participate when I'm confident in my answer, but often the questions are a bit dense/difficult so I just don't feel super confident that I'm right and thus don't really speak up every time.
- I didn't ask any questions during the discussion portion of the lecture notes because I felt that I understood the lecture notes well from reading them before class
- I thought I understood the material decently well this week, I didn't ask any questions because I thought I understood xLW1, xLW2, xLW3 pretty well, and I didn't really have any questions until certain parts of the R tutorial.

- im so curious how you generate your exit codes. is it random? is there a method? do we get to know

7:00-7:05 Cold Open
- Highlight latest internships
- Discuss lone question from last time

7:05-7:10 Re-assign tables for Unit #2

7:10-7:25 Discussion #1
- Jesus Luzardo
  - 14-7, 4.08 ERA, 3.01 FIP, 176.2 IP, 4.8 fWAR, 3.6 rWAR
- Freddy Peralta
  - 17-6, 3.61 ERA, 2.65 FIP, 169.2 IP, 3.6 fWAR, 5.4 rWAR
- Which player would you rank higher on your Cy Young ballot for 2025?
- Which player would you rather have on your team in 2026?

7:25-7:45 Introduce BABIP, FIP and DIPS
- What do you know about BABIP? (it's noisy)
  - What implications does this have for evaluating batters?
    - Connect it to RE24 -> LW -> xLW3 -> xLW2 -> xLW1
  - Discuss how we use the Bayesian model from class to answer the question: How much is BABIP luck?
    - Connect the model to the lme4::lmer code we use to estimate it
  - What implications does this have for evaluating pitchers?
- DIPS = Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics
- FIP = (13 * HR + 3 * (BB + HBP) - 2 * K) / IP
  - Due to Voros McCracken (early 2000s)
  - Discuss how we'll use the model to estimate how much weight to put on each outcome for pitchers

7:45-8:00 Discussion #2
- Some pitchers are known for consistently outperforming the league-average BABIP. Do you think this reflects true skill, or could it be explained by other factors (e.g., defense, park effects, randomness)?
- What are some limitations of FIP as a measure of pitcher performance? In what types of situations might ERA or another stat give us better information?
- Imagine you wanted to extend the DIPS framework with modern tracking data (e.g., Statcast). What new variables might help separate pitcher skill from randomness on balls in play?

8:00-8:05 Introduce BABIP/FIP/DIPS R tutorial

8:05-8:10 Break

Reflections
- I should really refrain from sharing my opinions on open-ended discussion questions
- R tutorial was more quiet than usual, but it seemed students made good progress

## 2024-08-29

9:25-9:30 Introduce the four units of the class

9:30-9:30 Randomly assign students to tables

9:30-9:40 Give students time to get to know each other

9:40-9:55 discuss Pythagorean formula
- What is the Pythagorean formula?
- What is the purpose of the Pythagorean formula?
- How might a baseball executive leverage the Pythagorean formula in their decision-making?

9:55-10:00 Think for yourself: At what number of games do we prefer actual winning percentage over Pythagorean winning percentage?

10:00-10:05 Pair discussion

10:05-10:10 Larger group discussion

10:10-10:10 Highlight what's important in the syllabus

10:10-10:40 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record

Reflections
- I created a "questions scoreboard" with the two tables competing against each other to ask questions. This worked very well to create an open environment. Students seemed very engaged.
- Residual winning percentage is a really tough one to conceptualize the noise.

Subjective Rating: 4/5

Odd Table: 7
Even Table: 10


## 2024-09-03

Announce that we will not meet on Sep 12

9:25-9:55 Review and complete last week's lecture
- Give visual representation of signal variance and noise variance
- Derive the ratio at which actual record is preferable to Pythag
- Discuss how we're going to estimate signal and noise variance

9:55-10:05 Think/Pair/Share: Propose a model that projects a team's record based on run differential that is different from the Pythagorean formula.

10:05-10:35 Get started on the first R tutorial

10:35-10:40 Give students time to complete exit ticket

Reflections
- Planned 30-minute lecture went way short (not much engagement)
- Lecture was slow and boring (need to add excitement)
- Students didn't like the discussion question very much (conversation died quickly)
- The R tutorial was well-paced (only did the first two exercises)

Subjective Rating 3/5

Odd Table: 7 + 4 = 11
Even Table: 10 + 3 = 13

Feedback
- What are some R resources we can use outside of class if we are struggling?
- I am a bit confused still on the difference in variances in the models (blue vs black).
- I just need to brush up on my R. I have not done much with R over the last few months.
- I'm just rusty after not coding for a while
- More of a statement than a question, but, I understand what I need to do, I just have never used R so I need to figure out how to actually do it.


## 2024-09-05

- Announce that we will not meet on Sep 12!

9:25-9:35 Discuss sigma^2_eta and sigma^2_Z again
- Talk about how Var(Z_i) = sigma^2_eta + sigma^2_Z / n
- Show that the split half correlation for Z_i is 0.5 when n = sigma^2_Z / sigma^2_eta
- Show that X_i is a better estimate than Y_i of mu_i + eta_i when n < sigma^2_Z / sigma^2_eta

9:35-10:35 Students work on Pythagorean formula notebok

10:35-10:40 Give students time to complete exit tickets

Student questions/confusions
- Knowing when to use dplyr and what structure the data needs to be in for me to use dplyr

Reflections
- The pacing was about right today although the math on the whiteboard was a bit fast

Announcement
1. Assignment #2 is posted

Top feedback from course eval:
1. "the first homework kinda felt like it was hanging us out to dry just asking us to 'model'. Some idea of an approach would've definitely been helpful, and I think giving us some guidance/starting places would allow us to engage with more complex material and actually understand the applications"
2. "it has been pretty theoretical and I wish that there were some more comparisons relating what we are learning to either specific players or recent decisions that baseball teams have made."

"I got lost slightly in the selection bias conversation. How did the graph of selection bias represent something different than causal/observational stuff's differences? It felt like I understood selection bias as a result of the population we generally sample from, and then it was corrected for mathematically in both models but more so in one? I'm not even sure to be honest, I just got confused in all of the information."

"How were the ranges for w and c values chosen? How are we able to come up with those for different contexts when making our own projections?"

"I think the first couple exercises tripped me up with just not knowing what exactly you wanted. For example, when you stated you wanted performance for each row, I did not know what performance encapsulated. For the most part, everything was good though."

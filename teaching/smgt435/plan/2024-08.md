# SMGT 435: Baseball Analytics

## 2024-08-29

9:25-9:30 Introduce the four units of the class

9:30-9:30 Randomly assign students to tables

9:30-9:40 Give students time to get to know each other

9:40-9:55 discuss Pythagorean formula
- What is the Pythagorean formula?
- What is the purpose of the Pythagorean formula?
- How might a baseball executive leverage the Pythagorean formula in their decision-making?

9:55-10:00 Think for yourself: At what number of games do we prefer actual winning percentage over Pythagorean winning percentage?

10:00-10:05 Pair discussion

10:05-10:10 Larger group discussion

10:10-10:10 Highlight what's important in the syllabus

10:10-10:40 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record

Reflections
- I created a "questions scoreboard" with the two tables competing against each other to ask questions. This worked very well to create an open environment. Students seemed very engaged.
- Residual winning percentage is a really tough one to conceptualize the noise.

Subjective Rating: 4/5

Odd Table: 7
Even Table: 10

Announce that we will not meet on Sep 12

9:25-9:55 Review and complete last week's lecture
- Give visual representation of signal variance and noise variance
- Derive the ratio at which actual record is preferable to Pythag
- Discuss how we're going to estimate signal and noise variance

9:55-10:05 Think/Pair/Share: Propose a model that projects a team's record based on run differential that is different from the Pythagorean formula.

10:05-10:35 Get started on the first R tutorial

10:35-10:40 Give students time to complete exit ticket

Reflections
- Planned 30-minute lecture went way short (not much engagement)
- Lecture was slow and boring (need to add excitement)
- Students didn't like the discussion question very much (conversation died quickly)
- The R tutorial was well-paced (only did the first two exercises)

Subjective Rating 3/5

Odd Table: 7 + 4 = 11
Even Table: 10 + 3 = 13

Feedback
- What are some R resources we can use outside of class if we are struggling?
- I am a bit confused still on the difference in variances in the models (blue vs black).
- I just need to brush up on my R. I have not done much with R over the last few months.
- I'm just rusty after not coding for a while
- More of a statement than a question, but, I understand what I need to do, I just have never used R so I need to figure out how to actually do it.

- Announce that we will not meet on Sep 12!

9:25-9:35 Discuss sigma^2_eta and sigma^2_Z again
- Talk about how Var(Z_i) = sigma^2_eta + sigma^2_Z / n
- Show that the split half correlation for Z_i is 0.5 when n = sigma^2_Z / sigma^2_eta
- Show that X_i is a better estimate than Y_i of mu_i + eta_i when n < sigma^2_Z / sigma^2_eta

9:35-10:35 Students work on Pythagorean formula notebok

10:35-10:40 Give students time to complete exit tickets

Student questions/confusions
- Knowing when to use dplyr and what structure the data needs to be in for me to use dplyr

Reflections
- The pacing was about right today although the math on the whiteboard was a bit fast

Subjective Rating: 4/5

Odd Table: 11 + 5 = 15
Even Table: 13 + 0 = 13

Announcements
- Assignment #1 is released, deadline pushed back 1 week

9:25-9:55 Base-Out Run Expectancy and Linear Weights lecture, part 1

9:55-10:05 Discussion break
- Think/pair/share: What are the advantages and disadvantages of RE24 and LW relative to each other?
- Follow-up questions
  - If you were creating a WAR metric, which would you use as the basis for batter evaluation?
  - What reasons might the residual RE24 - LW reflect true talent rather than luck?

10:05-10:35 Base-Out Run Expectancy and Linear Weights lecture, part 2 (regression to the mean)

10:35-10:40 Give students time to complete exit tickets

Questions
Odd Table: 15 + 8 = 23
Even Table: 13 + 16 = 29

Student Interest:      4.56/5
Student Understanding: 3.00/5

Reflections
- This lecture is very math heavy, probably unnecessarily so
- Ran out of time to work the example at the end

Subjective Rating: 3/5

"I think it would be helpful to give more specific examples while explaining the formula to kind of understand it in a conceptual perspective too."

"Very curious where the discussion of shifts comes into play with whether or not to include spray angle in the model."

Reflections
- Review of last week's lecture/tutorial went 40 minutes! (budgeted 10)
  - This was a good use of time because students had questions
- Had to rush through the lecture a little bit

Subective Rating 4/5

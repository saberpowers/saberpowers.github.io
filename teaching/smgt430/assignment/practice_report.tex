  \section*{\sc Practice: Report}

    Based on the results you obtained on Assignment \#1: The Big Game, in this practice assignment you will write two paragraphs.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item In the first paragraph, report your subjective belief about the Super Bowl win probability based on the results you obtained. Although subjective, you must report a number (for example, ``the probability of Team X winning is XX\%''). Please do your best to ignore the actual outcome of the Super Bowl when reporting this number. Use your quantitative results as a starting point, and move the prediction up or down based on your understanding of the limitations of the models. Explain your reasoning.
      \item In the second paragaph, imagine you are writing the concluding paragraph of a report in which you were asked to estimate the probability of each team winning the Super Bowl. Recall from our workshop that the purpose of the concluding paragraph is to (1) signal the ending; (2) restate the prupose of the report; (3) restate the key results; and (4) state why the findings matter (end with a bang).
    \end{enumerate}

    Submit your two paragraphs in a single .pdf file on Canvas.

\textbf{\textsc{Topics}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  The course is divided into $3$ units, each approximately $4$ weeks:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Unit $1$: Measuring Team Strength\\
    Pythagorean Formula, Bradley-Terry Model, ELO Ratings
    \item Unit $2$: Evaluating Player Talent\\
    Regression to the Mean, Hierarchical Models, Projections, Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus
    \item Unit $3$: Valuing Event Outcomes\\
    Win Probability, Markov Chains, Markov Reward Processes, Markov Decision Processes
  \end{itemize}
\end{adjustwidth}


~\\
\textbf{\textsc{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use R to apply theoretical statistical models to real-world sports data, and interpret the results.
    \item Calculate estimates of team and player strengths, adjusting for sample size and strength of schedule.
    \item Estimate in-game win probability models based on game state (e.g. score, possession, time remaining).
    \item Identify an interesting research problem in sports, solve it with data, and present your solution.
  \end{itemize}
\end{adjustwidth}

\textbf{\textsc{How Your Grade Is Determined}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
	Sport analytics is a demanding and highly competitive field. This class aims to provide the tough but honest feedback that you will need to succeed in it. Note that the points below sum approximately (but not exactly) to $100$. Your grade is based on your percentage earned of available points.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rclcrclcrcl}
                      &               &     & & $[93\%,\,\infty)$ & $\rightarrow$ & A & & $[90\%, 93\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& A--\\
      $[87\%, 90\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& B+  & & $[83\%, 87\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & B & & $[80\%, 83\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& B--\\
      $[77\%, 80\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& C+  & & $[73\%, 77\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & C & & $[70\%, 73\%)$ & $\rightarrow$	& C--\\
      $[67\%, 70\%)$  & $\rightarrow$	& D+  & & $[63\%, 67\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & D & & $[60\%, 63\%)$ & $\rightarrow$  & D--\\
                      &               &     & & $[ 0\%, 60\%)$  & $\rightarrow$ & F\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
   
  \textbf{Practices.} ($10$pts) There are $2$ practice assignments, each worth $5$pts, each graded for completion. The expected completion time for each practice is $4$ hours.
 
  \textbf{Assignments.} ($30$pts) There are $3$ individual assignments, each worth $10$pts. You are encouraged to help each other, but your submission must reflect work you have done yourself. Assignments will be graded anonymously, so please remove any personally identifying information from your submission. The expected completion time for each assignment is $8$ hours.

  \textbf{Project.} ($40$pts) This is a project-based course, and the project you build in stages over the course of the semester will determine a large chunk of your grade. You are encouraged to work with a partner on the project (no more than $2$ students per team), but you may work individually if you wish.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Project \#$0$ ($0$pts): Registration                   \hfill expected hours: $1$
    \item Project \#$1$ ($5$pts): Proposal                       \hfill expected hours: $4$
    \item Project \#$2$ ($10$pts): Abstract                      \hfill expected hours: $8$
    \item Project \#$3$ ($5$pts): Presentation                   \hfill expected hours: $4$
    \item Project \#$4$ ($20$pts): Paper                         \hfill expected hours: $16$
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Exit Tickets.} ($0.5$pts per class) We will end most classes with an anonymous survey graded for completion. Showing up and engaging in discussions are important parts of your learning experience in this course.

  \textbf{Article Report.} ($10$pts, SMGT $530$ only) There is one additional assignment for graduate students enrolled in SMGT $530$. You will read and write a report on a published academic journal article of your choice.
\end{adjustwidth}

\textbf{\textsc{Policies}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  \textbf{Attendance Policy.} If you notify me via email at least one hour before class that you will be absent, then I will excuse you from completing the exit ticket. Please do not expect a response to your email. It is your responsibility to check the schedule and educate yourself on the material you missed.

  \textbf{Generative AI Policy.} Generative AI may hinder your learning when used irresponsibly. To that end:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item You may use generative AI to help you solve coding problems, but it is a violation of the honor code to submit AI-generated code that you do not understand or cannot explain.
    \item It is a violation of the honor code to submit AI-generated writing as your own work.
  \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Late Policy.} Late submissions are subject to $10\%$ deduction per day.

\textbf{\textsc{Title IX Responsible Employee Notification}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  At Rice University, unlawful discrimination in any form, including sexual misconduct, is prohibited under Rice Policy on Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Policy 830) and the Student Code of Conduct.

  Please be aware that all employees of Rice University are ``mandatory reporters'', which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.

  Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

  To report sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@rice.edu. To explore supportive measures and other resources that are available to you, please visit the Office if Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support at safe.rice.edu.

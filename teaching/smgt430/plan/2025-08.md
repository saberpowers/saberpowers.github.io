## 2024-08-26

1:00-1:15 Last Name Dice Game Exercise
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

1:15-1:35 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

Final thoughts:
- Fundamentally, sport analytics is about understanding how games work
- For the Last Name Dice Game, this is very easy, and for other sports its harder
- But fundamentally what we do for other sports is the same

1:35-1:40 introduce the four units and assign students to tables

1:40-1:50 give students a chance to meet their tables

1:50-2:05 Think/Pair/Share The SCORE Network (scorenetwork.org)
- 1:50-1:55 Ask students to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
- 1:55-2:00 Ask students to discuss at their tables
- 2:00-2:05 Larger group discussion
  - Ask each student to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
  - What could you do with these data?
  - What other cool datasets are you aware of?

2:05-2:10 run through the syllabus

2:10-2:15 students complete survey

Notes

- No class Sep 18
- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - How to upload data
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

Questions from last time
- What is the advantage of learning R instead of Python or other languages
- Are we always going to be using Colab or will we be using Rstudio, jupyter or any other programs?
- Need to get used to doing R in Colab, used to doing it in RStudio
- I'd love to learn more about various packages that are commonly used in Sport Analytics that I'm likely not aware of
- Get some problems about for loop, logic is kind of different with Python, little bit confusing on it. 
- I felt like I had a good grasp on much of the baseline R material (i.e. sections 1 and 2) but found the dplyr and ggplot sections to be much more challenging, mainly because I am simply more inexperienced with those packages.

1:00-1:10 Review leftover questions from last time

1:10-1:15 introduce pythagorean formula, invite questions

1:15-1:30 discussion part 1 (think/pair/share 1/5/9)
- Find an appropriate website to answer the following questions, using Pythagorean exponent alpha = 2:
  a. Which NFL team had the best Pythagorean record last year?
  b. Which NFL team had the worst Pythagorean record last year?
  c. Which NFL team most over-performed their Pythagorean record last year?
  d. Which NFL team most under-performed their Pythagorean record last year?

1:30-1:45 lecture on optimization of alpha (grid search)

1:45-2:00 discussion part 2 (think/pair/share 1/5/9)
1. Why is the Pythagorean formula important?
2. What properties of a sport would cause the Pythagorean exponent alpha to be bigger or smaller?
3. In what sports do you think the Pythagorean formula works well? In what sports do you think the Pythagorean formula doesn't work as well? Why?

Miller (2007) "A Derivation of the Pythagorean Won-Loss Formula in Baseball"

Questions from last time:
- So just to confirm, a high alpha means there is a high correlation between Actual Winning Percentage and Pythagorean Winning Percentage? So we would want alpha to be high?
- I still feel a little unclear on where exactly alpha comes from and what constitutes a high vs. a low alpha. I know that it has to do with the amount of points scored and/or the amount of random chance in a game, but it still feels a little nuanced to me.
- I still don't understand why a sport like soccer would have a higher alpha as compared to a sport like basketball. Like I understand that as Œ± tends to infinity, the Pythagorean winning percentage converges to 100% for any positive score differential (and 0% for any negative score differential). But how does the magnitude of the score differential affect the value of Œ±?
- In general, why would we not prefer sports with higher alpha values when using pythag win probability? Doesn't that imply we put more emphasis on score differential? Or is the randomness in sports like soccer too great to get consistent results?
- Also when we do a grid search, how do we determine a good range for the alphas?¬†"

1:00-1:15 Discuss questions from last time:
- DISCUSS THE RESULT OF THE R TUTORIAL!
- I would have liked more discussion on how managers of teams potentially use the Pythagorean formula (or don't).
  - How does the pythagorean formula (often used in a team setting) relate to specific player evaluation? Is there a way we use this information for direct player evaluation as opposed to overall team evaluation?
- What is the least squares problem you were talking about?
- At what point does Pythagorean Win% stabilize? Would an MLB team feel confident about the accuracy of its Pythagorean Win% by the end of May? By the end of June? By the trade deadline?

1:15-1:30 Discussion 1
1. Look for a website to answer the question: Which NFL team had the toughest strength of schedule last year? What method was used to come up with an answer?
2. When might we prefer to use win-loss outcome in the Bradley-Terry model instead of score differential?
3. In sports, team strength is not static but changes over time. How might the Bradley-Terry model be modified to account for evolving team performance across a season?

1:30-1:45 Open up to questions about the Bradley-Terry model
- Write the equations on the board, and then open to questions

1:45-2:00 Table Exercises
1. Why do we need to force $\beta_1 = 0$ in the Bradley-Terry model?
2. Suppose we estimate the Bradley-Terry model and find $\hat\beta_2 > 0$. What does this tell us about team 2?
3. Suppose we estimate the win-loss outcome model and find $\hat\beta_0 = 0.5$; $\hat\beta_2 = 1$; and $\hat\beta_p = 0.75$. What is the estimated probability that team $p$ beats team 2 at home?

Noteworthy comments from last class:

- I feel like I need more clarification on what each coefficient represents in terms of a sports context, maybe some more examples would be helpful for me.¬†
- In the last example, we discussed the meaning of Beta for win-loss. Is these Beta have different meaning in context of win-loss and score difference? For score diff, can we say that beta1 = 0, Beta2 = 2, means team2 will win 2 more points than team1?¬†
- the concept of log odds is confusing
- With a reference team being considered, how to leagues use the bradley terry model?¬† Do they run it 32 times with each team as a reference team and average the results

- How were the team Betas initially found? I know that it is compared against a reference team (Beta_0) and using training data. But how do we calculate the Betas that are used in the calculations? Is the score differential used here or later?
- How do we quantify home-field advantage with regard to probability? I understand that the beta values relate to log-likelihoods, but what actually leads us to get a value such as B0 = 0.5?
- How do you calculate the value of B0(home-field advantage)? Is that derived from another model or is that a given?
- Just curious as to the process/calculations of finding the beta coefficients
- Derivation of the formulae

- I'm still confused on when to use the normal distribution in the score differential model and when we decide it isn't a good choice

- Are there any special Bradley-Terry considerations for computing errors (or interpreting them) on the Betas? Or can you just do standard logistic regression error calculations?
- Sort of a side question, but Im wondering if & how the model accounts for special types of home court advantage. For example, Denver and Utah is known to have even greater home court advantage due to the elevation. Is the model able to account for this? And if so how?
- My biggest remaining question is what is the math behind model identifiability? Is it purely about the ability to add coefficients to betas or is there something greater.

- The material was pretty dense for me. I think understanding a lot of terminology itself would be helpful. For example, I remember learning about these distributions last year but I didn't fully remember them until you explained it and how our numbers fit into these distributions.¬†
- I felt like I understood our discussions fairly well, but I had a hard time grasping what everything meant in the large matrices on the reading. Could we maybe go over the matrix form and how it reads?

- The review at the beginning lasted 20 minutes, but that was fine
  - I screen-shared the questions from the exit ticket, and I think this worked well
- I forgot to copy over the updated solutions Colab notebook into the exercises Colab notebook
  - The students didn't really notice
- This R tutorial is super easy, but the students like that. I should make the Pythag tutorial easier

- I would still like to know more about choosing a reference team, if there is any criteria that goes into it. If teams were to use the Bradley Terry model, how would they choose that reference team?¬†

- I did feel like the matrix values were still a bit confusing to me. I may have missed when you said what rows hold what values but I was also confused about how those are used to calculate the other values. Maybe it would be helpful to see it quickly worked out on the board again.

- Can the Bradley-Terry model be effectively used in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or mixed martial arts, where there is also no "homecourt" advantage?

1:00-1:15 Review exit ticket questions

- Rahul's office hours: 3:30 to 4:30 on Wednesday in Martel commons

1:05-1:10 Discuss pressing questions from last exit ticket
- I‚Äôm still a bit confused on the differences between the Rasch Model and the regular Adjusted Box Plus-Minus? When should you use the Rasch Model instead and what are its benefits?
- Just want to confirm that the Rasch model reference teams for offense and defense don't have to be the same team, ie, the offensive reference team is the Atlanta Hawks, the defensive reference team is the Boston Celtics.
- Can you explain why the x^2 on the denominator of the plus-minus equation is necessary? If x is -1 or 1, that term just becomes 1. If x is 0, that term becomes 0, but there is already an x term on the numerator, which means your numerator is 0 and therefore the 0 in the denominator seems unnecessary.¬†

1:00-1:15 Review questions from last two exit tickets

- On publications like ESPN, there are other types of APM. Real, Optimized, Regularized... what are all the differences with these?
- I would like more information how models with stints adjust for the strategy of stint deployments, or if they do at all. Such as if there is an effect for the timing of a stint in a game, especially if the opposition stint has gone longer than expected, leaving them fatigued.
- Is there a way to adjust for a player being down a man in hockey (power play) or soccer (red card). I.e, is there a way to adjust for the fact the team is at a disadvantage for having less people?

- If you can't put if statements in the pipe, how do you alter the functions? (In question #2)
- How do you combine piping a dataframe with if statements/for loops?

- I didn't get to fitting the Rasch model in class, could you quickly give a run down of that code?¬†

- I'm a little bit stuck on the reference for the rasch model, why the low sample player automatically become the reference player? Is just simply because their id = 0
- Why did we opt to change the names and ids of low sample players instead of just cutting them from the data? Would it decrease our sample size too much or is there another reason to keep them there.¬†
- can you explain what the benefit was to assigning the reference coefficient to the aggregate of the low sample players? Is this just because the low sample players might be seen as more "average"?

- How does data cleaning/wrangling work? How can we learn more about this?
- What are the top 10 things you would say we would use a lot of: groupby, sort, mutate, etc.

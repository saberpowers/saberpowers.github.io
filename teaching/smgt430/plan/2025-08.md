# SMGT 430: Introduction to Sport Analytics

## 2024-08-26

1:00-1:15 Last Name Dice Game Exercise
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

1:15-1:35 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

Final thoughts:
- Fundamentally, sport analytics is about understanding how games work
- For the Last Name Dice Game, this is very easy, and for other sports its harder
- But fundamentally what we do for other sports is the same

1:35-1:40 introduce the four units and assign students to tables

1:40-1:50 give students a chance to meet their tables

1:50-2:05 Think/Pair/Share The SCORE Network (scorenetwork.org)
- 1:50-1:55 Ask students to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
- 1:55-2:00 Ask students to discuss at their tables
- 2:00-2:05 Larger group discussion
  - Ask each student to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
  - What could you do with these data?
  - What other cool datasets are you aware of?

2:05-2:10 run through the syllabus

2:10-2:15 students complete survey

Notes

- No class Sep 18
- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - How to upload data
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

1:00-2:10 Introduction to R Tutorial

2:10-2:15 Students complete exit tickets (3141)

Reflections
- We didn't get a lot of questions, but we got some
- The energy in the room felt good (students talking to each other)

Subjective Rating 4/5

Questions from last time
- What is the advantage of learning R instead of Python or other languages
- Are we always going to be using Colab or will we be using Rstudio, jupyter or any other programs?
- Need to get used to doing R in Colab, used to doing it in RStudio
- I'd love to learn more about various packages that are commonly used in Sport Analytics that I'm likely not aware of
- Get some problems about for loop, logic is kind of different with Python, little bit confusing on it. 
- I felt like I had a good grasp on much of the baseline R material (i.e. sections 1 and 2) but found the dplyr and ggplot sections to be much more challenging, mainly because I am simply more inexperienced with those packages.

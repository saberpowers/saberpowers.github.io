# SMGT 430: Introduction to Sport Analytics

## 2024-08-26

1:00-1:15 Last Name Dice Game Exercise
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

1:15-1:35 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

Final thoughts:
- Fundamentally, sport analytics is about understanding how games work
- For the Last Name Dice Game, this is very easy, and for other sports its harder
- But fundamentally what we do for other sports is the same

1:35-1:40 introduce the four units and assign students to tables

1:40-1:50 give students a chance to meet their tables

1:50-2:05 Think/Pair/Share The SCORE Network (scorenetwork.org)
- 1:50-1:55 Ask students to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
- 1:55-2:00 Ask students to discuss at their tables
- 2:00-2:05 Larger group discussion
  - Ask each student to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
  - What could you do with these data?
  - What other cool datasets are you aware of?

2:05-2:10 run through the syllabus

2:10-2:15 students complete survey

Reflections
- Last Name Dice Game is a great way to kick off the class

Notes

- No class Sep 18
- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - How to upload data
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

Reflections
- We didn't get a lot of questions, but we got some
- The energy in the room felt good (students talking to each other)

Questions from last time
- What is the advantage of learning R instead of Python or other languages
- Are we always going to be using Colab or will we be using Rstudio, jupyter or any other programs?
- Need to get used to doing R in Colab, used to doing it in RStudio
- I'd love to learn more about various packages that are commonly used in Sport Analytics that I'm likely not aware of
- Get some problems about for loop, logic is kind of different with Python, little bit confusing on it. 
- I felt like I had a good grasp on much of the baseline R material (i.e. sections 1 and 2) but found the dplyr and ggplot sections to be much more challenging, mainly because I am simply more inexperienced with those packages.

1:00-1:10 Review leftover questions from last time

1:10-1:15 introduce pythagorean formula, invite questions

1:15-1:30 discussion part 1 (think/pair/share 1/5/9)
- Find an appropriate website to answer the following questions, using Pythagorean exponent alpha = 2:
  a. Which NFL team had the best Pythagorean record last year?
  b. Which NFL team had the worst Pythagorean record last year?
  c. Which NFL team most over-performed their Pythagorean record last year?
  d. Which NFL team most under-performed their Pythagorean record last year?

1:30-1:45 lecture on optimization of alpha (grid search)

1:45-2:00 discussion part 2 (think/pair/share 1/5/9)
1. Why is the Pythagorean formula important?
2. What properties of a sport would cause the Pythagorean exponent alpha to be bigger or smaller?
3. In what sports do you think the Pythagorean formula works well? In what sports do you think the Pythagorean formula doesn't work as well? Why?

Miller (2007) "A Derivation of the Pythagorean Won-Loss Formula in Baseball"

Questions from last time:
- So just to confirm, a high alpha means there is a high correlation between Actual Winning Percentage and Pythagorean Winning Percentage? So we would want alpha to be high?
- I still feel a little unclear on where exactly alpha comes from and what constitutes a high vs. a low alpha. I know that it has to do with the amount of points scored and/or the amount of random chance in a game, but it still feels a little nuanced to me.
- I still don't understand why a sport like soccer would have a higher alpha as compared to a sport like basketball. Like I understand that as Œ± tends to infinity, the Pythagorean winning percentage converges to 100% for any positive score differential (and 0% for any negative score differential). But how does the magnitude of the score differential affect the value of Œ±?
- In general, why would we not prefer sports with higher alpha values when using pythag win probability? Doesn't that imply we put more emphasis on score differential? Or is the randomness in sports like soccer too great to get consistent results?
- Also when we do a grid search, how do we determine a good range for the alphas?¬†"

Questions from last time:
- "What is the least squares problem you were talking about.¬†
- I would have liked more discussion on how managers of teams potentially use the Pythagorean formula (or don't).
- At what point does Pythagorean Win% stabilize? Would an MLB team feel confident about the accuracy of its Pythagorean Win% by the end of May? By the end of June? By the trade deadline?
- How does the pythagorean formula (often used in a team setting) relate to specific player evaluation? Is there a way we use this information for direct player evaluation as opposed to overall team evaluation?
- Outside of the derivate looking like it would probably be obnoxious to do, are there other reasons not to do a gradient descent to find alpha? Do grid searches in general find better results when computationally feasible?

# SMGT 430: Introduction to Sport Analytics

## 2026-01-13

2:30-2:45 Last Name Dice Game
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

2:45-3:05 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

Final thoughts:
- Fundamentally, sport analytics is about understanding how games work
- For the Last Name Dice Game, this is very easy, and for other sports its harder
- But fundamentally what we do for other sports is the same

3:05-3:10 introduce the three units and assign students to tables

3:10-3:20 Give students time to get to know each other at their tables
- Ask each table to choose an NFL team name

3:20-3:35 Think/Pair/Share
- What are some important concepts in sport analytics?

3:35-3:40 run through the syllabus

3:40-3:45 students complete survey

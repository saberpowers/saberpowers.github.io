# SMGT 430: Introduction to Sport Analytics

## 2026-01-13

2:30-2:45 Last Name Dice Game
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

2:45-3:05 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

Final thoughts:
- Fundamentally, sport analytics is about understanding how games work
- For the Last Name Dice Game, this is very easy, and for other sports its harder
- But fundamentally what we do for other sports is the same

3:05-3:10 introduce the three units and assign students to tables

3:10-3:20 Give students time to get to know each other at their tables
- Ask each table to choose an NFL team name

3:20-3:35 Think/Pair/Share
- What are some important concepts in sport analytics?

3:35-3:40 run through the syllabus

3:40-3:45 students complete survey

Workshop: How to Wrangle Data in R

Reflections
- This was probably too much review for most students
- Next time, do fewer exercises and more live coding

2:40-3:20 Elo lecture

3:20-3:35 Discussion

3:35-3:45 Early course eval #1

## 2026-02-17

2:30-2:35 Review comments from early course eval #1

2:35-2:40 Create table assignments for unit #2

2:40-2:55 Free throw exercise to introduce RTTM
- population mean: 80%, population sd: 5%
- pass out true free throw percentages
  - explain that students must keep their numbers secret
- simulate 30 free throws
- identify the winner

2:55-3:05 Each table has to come up with a guess
- explain that students are now allowed to share their numbers

3:05-3:10 Discussion
- Ask high table and low table to explain their thought process
- How did you use the information on the slips of paper at your table?
  - How might you have used the information?

3:10-3:40 Regression to the mean introduction
- draw population bell curve on the board
  - population mean: 80%
  - population sd: 5%
- draw likelihood bell curve centered at 80% and centered at observed value
  - calculate the relative posterior likelihood of each
- Explain mechanics of Bayesian modeling
  - prior represents how improbable it would be to have each true talent
  - likelihood represents how improbability it would be to get that result from each true talent
  - we multiply them together to get the posterior distribution
- Performance = Talent + Luck
  - Regression to the mean: (n * (Observed Performance) + c * (Population Mean)) / (n + c)
  - Ask students to fill in Observed Performance, Population Mean, n and c
  - c = noise variance / population variance
- predict the number on the winner's card

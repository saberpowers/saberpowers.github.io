- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

2:30-2:35 introduce students to Google Colab

2:35-3:40 allow students to work through R tutorial at their own pace

3:40-3:45 leave time to complete exit ticket

Reflections
- Encouraging students to ask questions when stuck or lost was very effective---Lou and I were bouncing around answering individual questions for the whole class period.
- It seems that this tutorial was too difficult for the first day of using R in class. Last semester I started with a simple introduction to R tutorial which was more appropriate.

3:00-3:10 Pythagorean Formula assignment discussion
- Students discuss their results at their tables
  - Table by table, ask students to
- Ask students to plot their sport (x = actual/actual correlation, y = pythag/actual correlation)
- Follow-up questions:
  - What do you observe (in the plot)?
  - If you were a GM for [insert sport] vs [insert sport], how would you behave differently?
  - What is it about these sports that makes them different in this way?

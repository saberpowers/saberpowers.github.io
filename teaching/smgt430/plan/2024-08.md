## 2024-08-29

2:30-2:45 Last Name Dice Game Exercise
- not sure how long this will take
- Everyone plays round-robin, then 4-person playoff
- Ask students to guess the winner of each matchup

2:45-3:05 Discussion Questions
- How would you have chosen the winner if we didn't see the last names?
- How would this game have been different if we used 6-sided dice?
- How would this game have been different if we used 20-sided dice?
- How is this game different from soccer?
- How is this game similar to soccer?
- What do the dice represent?
- What do your last names represent?

3:05-3:10 introduce the four units and assign students to tables

3:10-3:20 give students a chance to meet their tables

3:20-3:35 Think/Pair/Share The SCORE Network (scorenetwork.org)
- Ask each student to find what they think is the most interesting dataset
- What could you do with these data?
- What other cool datasets are you aware of?

3:35-3:40 run through the syllabus

okay to end class early today

Reflections
- Last Name Dice Game was good for getting students interacting with each other

Reflections
- Students were extremely engaged with good questions during lecture

- Ground rules for R days:
  - Save a copy to your drive
  - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> R
  - I think there's a natural tendency to think that if you're struggling or confused, it's your fault, and that can make it more difficult to ask questions. I encourage you to raise your hand a lot when you feel lost. Right now is the opportunity for me to provide that instruction to you.

2:30-2:35 introduce students to Google Colab

2:35-3:40 allow students to work through R tutorial at their own pace

3:40-3:45 leave time to complete exit ticket

Reflections
- Encouraging students to ask questions when stuck or lost was very effective---Lou and I were bouncing around answering individual questions for the whole class period.
- It seems that this tutorial was too difficult for the first day of using R in class. Last semester I started with a simple introduction to R tutorial which was more appropriate.

2:30-3:00 Bradley-Terry lecture, part 1

3:00-3:10 Pythagorean Formula assignment discussion
- Students discuss their results at their tables
  - Table by table, ask students to
- Ask students to plot their sport (x = actual/actual correlation, y = pythag/actual correlation)
- Follow-up questions:
  - What do you observe (in the plot)?
  - If you were a GM for [insert sport] vs [insert sport], how would you behave differently?
  - What is it about these sports that makes them different in this way?

3:10-3:40 Bradley-Terry lecture, part 1

3:40-3:45 Give students time to complete exit tickets

Questions
Table 1/2/3/4: 7/4/7/8 + 5/4/4/9 = 12/8/11/17

Student Interest      4.76/5
Student Understanding 4.24/5

Reflections
- The activity of plotting their homework results was very engaging
- Some students were yawning during the first half of the lecture
- I split the lecture at the wrong point (first half was too long)

Subjective Rating 4/5

"I am still a bit confused about the difference between the linear and logistic when it comes to predicting future outcomes. How do those two differ when used practically?"

3:40-3:45 Give students time to complete exit tickets (7845)

Student Interest      4.76/5
Student Understanding 3.76/5

"I feel like it would've been easier for me to understand the models if the summation notations were explained more. I am still a little confused on that part of the models."
"I'm still a bit confused on the actual calculation process for beta since we didn’t have as clear of an example as with the bradley-terry model"

Reflections
- This went pretty much according to plan
- We drew the matrix X on the board, but it would have been good to draw Y on the board as well

"Where can I find good documentation for DPLYR. Is there a cheat sheet that I can use? I never know how to use the dplyr functions."
"the equation for the adjusted plus-minus model + i hope we go thru the rasch model a bit more cuz we didnt cover it too much during class"

Reflections
- Most students got about 80% through the tutorial
- I need to introduce each function that I expect students to use

Subjective Rating 4/5

3:35-3:45 Course Eval #1 (7495)

Questions: Table 1/2/3/4: 1/1/0/0 + 5/0/3/2 = 6/1/3/2

Reflections
- This was the first time I've ever had several students completing all of the exercises, and most of them did it with 5-10 minutes to spare
- It would be good to make the challenge question more challenging so that students don't completely finish everything laid out in front of them

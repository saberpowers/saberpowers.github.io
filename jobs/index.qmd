```{r, echo = FALSE}
jobs <- read.csv("../assets/jobs.csv")
logos <- read.csv("../assets/logos.csv")
data <- jobs |>
    dplyr::mutate(team = stringr::str_trim(team, side = "both")) |>
    dplyr::left_join(logos, by = "team") |>
    dplyr::transmute(
        date_posted,
        team = glue::glue("
            <span style='display:inline-block;text-align:center;width:33px'>
                <img height='22' src='{logo_url}'>
            </span>
            {team}
        "),
        title = glue::glue("<a target='_blank' href='{url}'>{title}</a>"),
        discipline,
        stage,
        sport
    )
DT::datatable(
    data = data,
    colnames = c("Date Posted", "Team", "Title", "Discipline", "Stage", "Sport"),
    escape = FALSE,
    style = 'bootstrap'
)

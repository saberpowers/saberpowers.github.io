    "text": "Selecting Research Questions\n\nBe aware that when attempting to measure intangibles like momentum or clubhouse chemistry, the signal to noise ratio is often low. That means you generally need large amounts of data and sophisticated analysis methods to pick up on the signal. If you’re just getting started in sport analytics, I recommend picking research questions about more tangible aspects of sports.\n\n\n\nDeveloping Metrics\n\nSomething I see from students occasionally is that they will “make up” a metric by throwing some existing metrics together through multiplication or addition with only a hand-wavy justification of what the made-up metric is measuring. I want you to understand that metrics are derived (as estimands of model parameters) rather than “invented”.\n\n\n\nReporting Results\n\nWhen reporting numeric results, don’t report too many digits.\nFor example, when you use R or Python to calculate the correlation between two vectors, your computer might spit out a result like 0.13083978. The interpretation of this output is that the correlation is 0.13. If you copy and paste the full number 0.13083978 into a report, that does two things:\n\nit injects white noise (083978) into your report, distracting the reader from what’s important; and\nit suggests to the reader that you don’t understand what is the meaning of your result.\n\nWhen presenting your results, your purpose is to convey meaning. As a simple rule of thumb, two or three significant digits would usually be appropriate for this purpose. Four digits would be pushing it, and five or more digits would be over the line.\nWhen plotting two variables that have the same unit of measurement, choose your x- and y-axis limits so that the aspect ratio is close to 1:1.\nThe scale that you choose for your x- and y-axes can have a huge impact on the perception and qualitative interpretation of your results. For example, consider the following two plots which display the exact same data (actual winning percentage on the x-axis and modeled winning percentage on the y-axis, same units for both variables: wins per game).\n \nAt first glance at the first plot, you might jump to the conclusion that modeled winning percentage aligns reasonably with actual winning percentage. But did you notice the scale of the y-axis? The second figure clearly communicates the important takeaway: modeled winning percentage is way more compressed than actual winning percentage. Perhaps this is how things should be, or perhaps this indicates a bug in your model. Either way, the second figure conveys the meaning of your results more effectively.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the list. I will add to it if/when I come across additional common pitfalls that compel me to write them up."

    "title": "Advice on becoming a competitive candidate for jobs in sport analytics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I was a hiring manager in analytics for the Dodgers, we would post an entry-level quantitative analyst position and receive nearly a thousand applications. Among those candidates, based on the application alone, roughly half would seem to be qualified for the entry-level position. Without the resources to interview 500 candidates, we had to decide which small subset of candidates would advance to the interview stage (this is its own challenge and a story for another day).\nI relay this experience to you because it conveys some perspective from the other side of the job application process. How will you separate yourself (before the interview stage) from the many other candidates who could be qualified for the position? The best way to make your resume rise to the top of the stack is to work on a research project and present it at a sport analytics conference. If a resume reviewer is already familiar with your work (assuming it’s good work) before seeing your name in the candidate pool, then they are much more likely to offer you an interview. Below, I’ve listed some opportunities to stand out.\nGeneral Sports. New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports (September, Boston) and Cascadia Symposium on Statistics in Sports (September, Vancouver) are sibling conferences, with NESSIS occurring in odd-numbered years and CASSIS occurring in even-numbered years. The academic quality of presentations at these conferences is generally very high. It can be difficult for students to earn presentation slots on stage, but there are also opportunities to give poster presentations. For women and candidates of non-binary gender, Women in Sports Data Symposium (September, Philadelphia) can be an excellent opportunity to present your work on stage in front of industry professionals, including hiring managers. The WISD Symposium features a strong industry presence of any gender in the audience.\nBaseball. Saberseminar (August, Chicago) is a very accessible entry point for students seeking to give their first on-stage presentation at a major conference, featuring 10-minute student presentation slots. Most MLB clubs sponsor and send representatives to Saberseminar. SABR Analytics Conference (March, Phoenix) is a bit more competitive to get a presentation slot, and it is also well-sponsored and well-attended by MLB clubs.\nFootball. It’s not a conference, but the NFL’s Big Data Bowl is the hiring pipeline for football analytics. The contest typically runs from October into January and features thousands(!) of entrants. For this contest, the NFL makes available tracking(!) data and as much as $100,000(!) in prize money. The top contestants are invited to present their work at the NFL Combine (Indianapolis, February) in front of a star-student judge panel that may include a current NFL player(!).\nSoccer. For those of you in Europe (sorry for calling it soccer), Statsbomb Conference (Manchester, October) and Opta Forum (London, March) both allow students (and non-students) to submit research proposals. The top proposals receive proprietary data to complete their projects and invitations to present their work on stage at the events. For those of you in the Americas, the nascent American Soccer Insights Summit (Houston, January) follows a similar format, with a call for proposals, proprietary data and an opportunity to present on stage."

I spent five seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where I got a World Series ring as the analytics director in 2020; and I spent one season with the Houston Astros, where I got another World Series ring as an assistant general manager in 2022. By working with two of the most successful teams of the analytics era, I learned how front offices develop strategies to win championships.\nNow I am an assistant professor of sport analytics and of statistics at Rice University. These days, I think and write about how competitors should and do respond to rules put in place by leagues. I am interested in how league officials can design incentive structures to make their competitions safer for athletes and more entertaining to fans. Meanwhile, I am developing statistical methodology for modeling kinematic tracking data, with applications in player health and safety.\nI am lucky in that I have adorable little kids and spend lots of quality time with my family.
